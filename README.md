# fen-chess-positions
Webapp to predict FEN positions of a chessboard

This app takes an image of a chessboard (from the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koryakinp/chess-positions) and converts it to its FEN sequence. Download the dataset and select a photo from the dataset/test/ folder. Some sample images are included in the repo.

To run the app, run the following commands in the terminal:

`cd fen-chess-positions`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`streamlit run app.py`
